# MOTD

Message Of The Day  for `Iridium Overview` ingame chat channel.

MOTD is unfortunately limited to maximum of 4000 characters including formatting (non-standard HTML).

Individual shared install links are limited to 16 filters, thus the overview pack is split to 3 parts and additional tab settings variations:

- Part 1: main tab settings, all filters used by the default tabs
- Part 2: ships only filters
- Part 3: remaining filters except ships only filters
- Tab icons: alternative tab settings (tab titles are replaced by 'icons')
- Carbon mode: alternative tab settings (more compact, meant for users who prefer only single overview window, multiboxers and smaller screen resolutions)
