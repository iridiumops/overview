Hello space friends,
I am writing this because I have sort of disappeared for a while from EVE, and for that I owe an apology to all users of Iridium Overview. Mainly because, for a long time, I have marketed it as the most complete and up-to-date overview pack. And for years it was... until recently.

But fear not. The updated version for current expansion is now available. Thank you all for your patience.

And further thanks to everyone who reached out, reminding me to finally do it :)

P.S. If I ever disappear again, you are all free to just fork the overview pack, all files are on GitHub now, released as open source. Or just use the EVE University overview pack - it's quite alright.

## v2.9.4 (2023/05/02)

Carbon UI Legacy version updated to be in line with v3.1.0

Btw if you haven't switched to the v3 and still use the v2.9 let me know why, since I will probably stop updating it.

## v3.1.0 (2023/05/02)

New version takes advantage of the expanded tab limit.
Improved compatibility with recent updates that broke the tab renaming ingame.
Based on popular demand, I am expanding the overview beyond the 32 preset limit with 3rd installation link ingame.

## v2.9.3 (2022/11/26)

Uprising - EVE 20.10

Update for legacy v2 Carbon UI branch.

```
* Update to be compatible with Photon UI 
+ Added new FW BS NPCs
+ Added FW objective objects
+ Added mission NPC capsules
- Removed more old POS stuff
- Removed POSes from DCSAN presets
```

## v3.0.0 (2022/11/26)

Uprising - EVE 20.10

New Major version. 

Note: Version 3 branch will be maintained alongside v2.9 for a while.

The biggest change is splitting system navigation (gates, beacons, stations etc.) from main PVE and PVP combat tabs to its own System tab, this allows more granular control, removes clutter for those who prefer cleaner overview and frees up presets for other things. I have unified PVE and PVP presets and bracket presets into a set of PVX presets, but it should feel very familiar to anyone used to the older version while keeping or even increasing easy customization options. I have taken the opportunity to change the naming scheme of presets (now named filters by CCP) to be more verbose, but hopefully clearer to new players and more consistent. Version 3 also uses the new per tab column settings. I am changing NPC corporation members standings to behave as neutral standings do now, due to feedback and to be closer to the new reworked default overview, which is great improvement over the old one, but still far from good custom ones imho. Unfortunately we are still limited to 8 tabs, so System tab replaced dedicated Travel tab, which isn't really needed now and Ships Only tab replaced Friendly/Fleet tab, which now defaults to enemy ships, but can easily be changed back as both presets remain available. Also, due to popular demand new bracket preset without wrecks is included. There are a lot of smaller changes but nothing else really worth singling out.

For now, I am not making a version with compact tab icons, since I don't know if anyone really uses it and it was confusing some new players.

Sadly multiple windows and per tab column settings is where improvements on CCP side of things end, at least for now. Asteroid brackets, moon brackets and colour preset names are still not fully supported. Nor anything else community suggested. But I take it.
