# YAML files

Instead of having one large unwieldy YAML file, Iridium Overview is split into individual parts, allowing to easily generate alternative versions with different sets of filters or tab settings variations.

During the build process, filter files get updated with data from SDE in form of comments, however all YAML comments are stripped from final YAML file.
